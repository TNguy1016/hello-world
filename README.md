# hello-world
This must be a test.
I haven't taken a test in years.
I used to be able to code, but have forgotten everything.
I remember hand machine coding before we had an assembler.  It could take half a day just to write a capital "A" on the screen.
Heck, I remember PDP8e series by Digital which was housed in a big cabinet with many pcb boards.  We would take a few hours to code the original machine so it would turn on the cassette drives so we could finally load saved code to do whatever we had coded before.  To code the original machine, there were nine switches.  You would turn eight switches ON or OFF as needed, and then push the other switch to load that one byte into memory.  Then you repeated the process hundreds of times to get every byte of data loaded.
